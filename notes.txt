If you want to format your error messages in the way fmt.Printf() works, 
you can use the fmt.Errorf() function, which simplifies the creation of custom error messages—the fmt.Errorf() function 
returns an error value just like errors.New().

When you pass an array to a function, what is happening is that Go creates a copy 
of that array and passes that copy to that function¿therefore any changes you make 
to an array inside a function are lost when the function returns.
